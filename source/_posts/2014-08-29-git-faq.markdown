I write this FAQ list for git problems, usually you can google on stackoverflow or somewhere...

## Change user.name/email on local repository
Sometimes you want to have different user name and email to override git global setting.

    $ git config user.name harrypan
    $ git config user.email gs0622@gmail.com

Also, you can review it in local git config

    $ tail -3 .git/config
    [user]
        name = harrypan
        email = harrypan

## Rollback remote git repository
Sometimes you decide to rollback couple commits in remote without revert then push, you can try below tips, however it assumes your local and remote repository are synced.
#### Hard reset commits in local repository
    $ git reset --hard HEAD~n
Here 'n' refer to commit numbers you want to reset, in case one or two commits you can also use HEAD or HEAD^.
#### Force push onto remote
    $ git push -f

## GitHub credential helper
Says you have repositories on GitHub, default/preferred protocol is https, you might be annoyed every push need to input user/password, using credential helper could help you for a period not need credential input

#### With git 1.7.9 and later
    $ git config --global credential.helper cache
Here its default timeout is 15 min, or you can select a longer time suggested by GitHub help

    $ git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"

#### With git before 1.7.9, or any version
I don't prefer those ways for personal flavor, you can refer to [Is there a way to skip password typing when using https:// github](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-github)

## Mirror a repository
Base on [GitHub Help: Duplicating a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository), here is my example to mirror [procps-ng](https://gitorious.org/procps) from gitorious onto my github

    $ # Make a *bare* clone of the repository
    $ git clone --bare https://gitorious.org/procps/procps.git
    # mirror-push onto existing github repository through github UI
    $ cd procps.git/
    $ git push --mirror https://github.com/gs0622/procps
    # clone again through *your* own repository
    $ cd ..
    # git clone https://github.com/gs0622/procps
