I resigned and studied at home for couple months, I self-studied from MIT OCW to MOOC.
Recently I found this article is a good summary for MOOC resource (in Mandarin) that you could evaluate, depend on your willing and passion.

[MOOC不止可汗學院、Coursera和edX：更多大規模開放在線課程介紹](http://www.thenewslens.com/post/36571/)

In this article, you could pick the MOOC resource in knowledge or in practice, I basically took MIT OCW, Cousera, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy ...etc.
I love their passion and learn much that I seldom cared about while I was busy.
Take the LFS101x, Introduction to Linux of edX, as example, I enjoyed it to review my Linux domain knowledge.
There are 18 chapters, depth from beginner to expert, I took time watching it and gain knowledge.

In a nuts shell, take a short time to review your career, interest, passion, then make some decision when you're available.
It's up to you, no matter how to choose and create for life or work.

-Cheers.
